# Weekend Redux Feedback Loop

[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md), this line may be removed once you have updated the README.md


## Description
_Duration: 3 day weekend project_

Students need a way to provide feedback to their instructors over the course of the program, ideally daily. And the program directors need a way to store that feedback for future use in decision making and also to intervene with struggling students who might need extra attention. 

I solve this by creating a feedback single page application that prompts users for feedback on a number of issues. How they're feeling emotionally, how well they're understanding the content, the support they've received from instructors, and any additional comments they make have. The individual feedback, once submitted, is stored in a data base accessible to instructors.
